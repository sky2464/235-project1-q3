For this program, we will calculate the lower bound of the given number 'x' (explained later in the code). Lower bound is calculated by expanding and modifying the code for binary search. Unlike binary search where we search for a number (inturn return an index specifying that number) here we will search for the first number (inturn the index) where the number is greater than or equal to the given number. This is done in log(n) time just like binary search. For this program we will use in-built C++ function lower bound function(explained later in the code)
